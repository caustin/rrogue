# The codebase has several significant issues:

## Critical Bugs:
- [X] Dice rolling logic error in dice.go:10
- [X] Rectangle intersection bug in rect.go:28
- [X] Input lag from hardcoded turn counter in main.go:38

## Architecture Issues:
- [X] Extensive use of global variables causing tight coupling
- Missing error handling for file operations and array bounds
- [X] Dead entities not properly cleaned up from ECS
- [X] Performance issues from repeated allocations in render loop

## Quality Issues:
- [X] No tests whatsoever (*_test.go files missing)
- Formatting inconsistencies across multiple files
- Unused functions like GetRandomInt() in dice.go
- Missing documentation for complex algorithms

## Security Concerns:
- No input validation for player movement
- Potential infinite loops in A* pathfinding and room generation
- No bounds checking on array access

Run go fmt ./... and go vet ./... to address the immediate formatting and static analysis issues.
